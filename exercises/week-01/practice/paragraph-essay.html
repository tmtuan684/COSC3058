        <h1>What good is logic?</h1>
        <p>1.Order.You may be wondering, "What can I do with logic?" The answer is that logic can do something with you. Logic builds the mental habit of thinking in an orderly way.</p>
        <p>2. Power. Logic has power: the power of proof and thus persuasion. Any power can be either rightly used or abused. This power of logic is rightly used to win the truth and defeat error; it is wrongly used to win the argument and defeat.</p>
        <p>3. Reading. Logic will help you with all your other courses, for logic will help you to read any book more clearly and effectively.</p>
        <p>4. Writing. Logic will also help you to write more clearly and effectively, for clear writing and clear thinking are a "package deal": the presence or absence of either one brings the presence or absence of the other.</p>
        <p>5. Wisdom. "Philosophy" means "the love of wisdom." Although logic alone cannot make you wise, it can help. For logic is one of philosophy's main instruments. Logic is to philosophy what telescopes are to astronomy or microscopes to biology or math to physics. You can't be very good at physics if you're very bad at math, and you can't be very good at philosophy if you're very bad at logic.</p>
        <p>6. Recognizing contradictions. One of the things you will learn in this course is exactly what contradiction means, how to recognize it, and what to do with it. Logic teaches us which ideas contradict each other.</p>
        <p>7. Certainty. Logic has "outer limits"; there are many things it can't give you. But logic has no "inner limits": like math, it never breaks down. Just as 2 plus 2 are unfailingly 4, so if A is B and B is C, then A is unfailingly C. Logic is timeless and unchangeable. It is certain. </p>
        <p>8. Truth. Our last reason for studying logic is the simplest and most important of all. It is that logic helps us to find truth, and truth is its own end: it is worth knowing for its own sake.</p>
